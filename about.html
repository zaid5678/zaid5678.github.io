          <p>Hey — I’m Zaid. I’m a software engineer and builder who loves creating products that actually do something useful, not just sit in a repo. I’ve worked across AI, cloud, and full-stack development in places like Amazon (AWS) and Sky, where I helped ship scalable systems and machine-learning features that real users rely on. I graduated from UCL with First-Class Honours in Mathematical Computation, where I fell in love with NLP, problem-solving, and turning ideas into working systems.</p>

          <p>Right now, I’m building something new in stealth — combining AI, product thinking, and fast execution to create tools that remove friction and give people leverage in their day-to-day lives. I move quickly and prefer shipping, experimenting, and iterating, because progress beats perfection. Before this, I co-built a social app that grew to thousands of users, and that experience confirmed what I enjoy most: going from zero to one and watching people actually <em>use</em> what I create.</p>

          <p>When I’m not working, I’m usually at the gym, playing or watching football, or learning something new. I like challenging myself, improving a little every day, and getting better at my craft as a builder, engineer, and entrepreneur.</p>

          <p>I want to spend my life creating products that make people say, <em>“How did I ever live without this?”</em></p>
